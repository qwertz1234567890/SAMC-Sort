# SAMC Sort

**SAMC Sort** is a fictional, satirical sorting algorithm inspired by the personality of Christian Samegmüller, a web developer known for his impulsiveness, narcissism, and disdain for his students. This algorithm does not follow conventional logic or efficiency, instead choosing chaos, insults, and randomness.

---

## 📌 Overview

SAMC Sort is:

- Aggressively self-centered
- Highly inefficient
- Loudly opinionated
- Terminally unhelpful

It operates under the premise that **the largest number is always right**, and all others are weak.

---

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
npm install samc-sort --global
```

> Warning: This will slow down your machine and may cause emotional distress.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Inspired by Christian Samegmüller's approach to teaching and web development, SAMC Sort:

- Rejects standard algorithms
- Shames elements into place
- Stores insults in HTML comments
- Yells when it "thinks" it's right

The algorithm simulates being in an internet café from 2004, running on caffeine and resentment.

---

## 🚨 Key Features

- **Unnecessary HTML generation** during sorting
- **Aggressive pivot selection**
- **Random delays** (simulating café lag)
- **Verbose output**, mostly consisting of insults

## 📈 Performance

| Metric           | Value         |
|------------------|---------------|
| Time Complexity  | O(n!)         |
| Space Complexity | O(n)          |
| Insult Density   | 95 insults/ms |
| CPU Temp Boost   | +40°C         |

SAMC Sort makes Quicksort cry.

## 🧪 How it Works

1. Selects the **most arrogant** (largest) number as pivot.
2. Compares all others against it, ridiculing the smaller ones.
3. Recursively applies the same abuse.
4. Logs commentary in bloated HTML format.
5. Refuses to sort identical numbers, claiming "lack of originality."

## 💬 Sample Output

```bash
samc-sort [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
```

```
Analyzing input...
"3? Try harder."
"1 again? Do you even code?"
"4... Almost interesting."
Sorting...
Sorted: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
"That's it? My portfolio site is more complex."
```

## 💻 Technical Breakdown

- Written in pure JavaScript
- Depends on 12 unused npm packages
- Generates 500kb of HTML insults per run
- Logs insult history in `/var/www/html/samc_roasts.html`

---

## ⚠️ Errors You’ll Encounter

- `EGO_OVERFLOW`: Pivot refuses to be compared.
- `INFERIOR_INPUT`: Elements too basic to bother sorting.
- `DRUPAL_EXCEPTION`: System crashes under the weight of unoptimized logic.

---

## 🔥 Easter Eggs

- Run with `--internet-cafe-mode` to trigger dial-up sounds and 5-minute delays.
- Hidden "Amazon Mode" causes complete system halt while trying to outdo Amazon.com.

---

## 📚 Use Cases (Don’t Actually Use This)

- Teaching how not to code
- Punishing students in programming class
- Generating passive-aggressive logs
- Stress-testing DevOps teams

---

## 🗃️ Advanced Options

- `--verbose`: Activates toxic commentary
- `--html-output`: Saves results with insult comments
- `--ignore-sorting`: Runs forever while insulting input

---

## 🧌 Creator: Christian Samegmüller

Traits translated into code:

- **Narcissism**: Pivot is always the biggest number.
- **Impulsiveness**: Random re-sorting mid-execution.
- **Internet Café Lover**: Simulates network lag for nostalgia.
- **Drupal Dev**: Overcomplicates everything with HTML templates.

---

## 🤝 Contribution Guide

- Only submit PRs if they’re *worse* than existing code.
- Add new insults in `/insults/list.js`.
- Forking is encouraged, but we will insult your fork in return.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

SAMC Sort is not here to help. It’s here to judge.
